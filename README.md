# Pair Matching Game (Memory)
This is a simple pair matching game. **The goal is to clear the board**, which one achieves by flipping the cards and finding the two with exact same symbol on them. When two same cards are flipped (or 'opened') - they disappear.
## Card flipping
Cards can be flipped by clicking/tapping on them. It is not possible to open more than two cards at the same time. When two cards are opened, they get compared and if they match - they disappear. If they do not match - they flip over ('close').
## Time, Moves and Stars
The game measures player's current game time and number of moves. The latter is used to determine the player's star rating.
* 3 stars - less than 12 moves
* 2 stars - less than 18 moves
* 1 star - 18+ moves
## Winning
When all 8 card pairs are found, the game is won and a summary message appears. It states how long it took the player to win, how many moves they made and the star rating. It also displays the restart button, so the player can start over.
